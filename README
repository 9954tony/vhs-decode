Note:  This is very early development code.  Therefore it is very, very ugly ;)

ld-decode takes the raw RF data signal (captured using cxadc) and converts it into a raw composite video signal.  audio is not decoded yet.

ntsc-decode takes that, time base corrects it, decodes the color, and then (currently) completely fails to comb filter it.

to run:  ./ld-decode [file] > [file].ld
./ntsc-decode [file].ld > [file].rgb

to view ld-decode output: display -size 910x512 -depth 16 gray:ldplant.ld 
to view ntsc-decode output: display -size 768x700 -depth 8 rgb:ldplant.rgb
use this command line to make it a .jpg:  convert -size 768x700 -depth 8  rgb:ntscbar.rgb -resize 100%x200% ntscbar.jpg

Piping ld-decode to ntsc-decode doesn't work yet, it's pre-loading the entire file for no good reason.

ld-decode has a lambda in it, so you'll need to use "-std=gnu++0x" to compile it.
