
This is ld-decode rev3 (aka JSON and the Argonauts)

There are a lot of changes - key things are that ld-decode-tools is now merged in (build and install from the tools/ directory), JSON metadata is now implemented, and ld-decode.py now outputs fields according to spec.  PAL processing is now greatly improved, and NTSC can look very nice as well :)
