This is rev5.1 of ld-decode and tools. rev5.1 fixes some additional issues from rev5, mostly with "imperfect" disks... 

(rev5 itself added lots of great new stuff, check out http://www.domesday86.com for details :)

NOTE:  This is still under development, and decoding quality, usability, and (especially) performance will hopefully improve in the coming months.
