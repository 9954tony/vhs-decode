
This is/will be ld-decode rev3 (aka JSON and the Argonauts).  There's still a bit more to do
before tagging a release, but it's in pretty decent shape now.

There are a lot of changes - key things are that ld-decode-tools is now merged in, ld-decode.py now outputs fields.  PAL processing is now greatly improved.
